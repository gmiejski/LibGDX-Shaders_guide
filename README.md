LibGDX-Shaders_guide
====================

This is a simple tutorial series made for myself as an introduction to Graphics course on AGH univesity.

Together with mateusz-ant with who I completed another project using Libgdx together with shaders completed this tutorial series with simple descriptions. Mayby it will lead others to better understanding of what is happening in this code :)

General things about those tutorials:

* you need java 8 to launch examples
* examples needs gradle to build and launch, as libgdx itself needs it
* there are 7 parts, each touching different topic


Structure
----------------------
* all shaders files reside in core/assets - this is where the first magic happens
* all libgdx files reside in core/src - this is where the second magic happens
* all examples can be run from corresponding desktop/src files


Running
----------------------
You can run those examples from IntelliJ, simply right click on selected file at desktop/src/... and click run.

Or launch them as a normal Java program, as those are simply running public static void main(...) functions

Other sources of knowledge
----------------------
We're not covering everything in here as we don;t want to copy knowledge from other sources.

Here are some links that helped us a lot in understanding this topic, so you should read them too when the time comes:

* http://blog.db-in.com/cameras-on-opengl-es-2-x/ - great tutorial explaining matrix operations - must read!



Special thanks

Thanks for mateusz-ant for his general help on those tutorials and during our project creation for university course :)
